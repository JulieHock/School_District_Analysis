# School_District_Analysis

## Overview:

The School District has collected data on students at all of their high schools, including reading and math scores.  We are asked to break down the data to easily see how each school, each type of school, and the district as a whole did in terms of students passing the reading and/or math tests.  After further investigation, it seems that they may have been some academic dishonesty for Thomas High School, in the 9th grade class.  We were then asked to rerun the data, without including the 9th graders from this school to see how it may change the results.  

## Results
* This district as a whole did not see much change in the data once the 9th graders at Thomas High School were taken out.  This is because there were 461 students, out of 39,170 that were not counted.  This is such a small percentage of the overall data removed, it did not make any difference in the district data as a whole.  
* Thomas High School (THS) did show some significant changes in their data with the 9th graders removed.  There was a total of 1,635 students at THS, so removing 461 student data showed a major change in the percent of passing in math, reading and overall.  The averages were not changed, which means the 9th graders did not hold any outliers.  In the percent passing math, it changed from 66.9% to 93.3% after the 9th graders were removed; likewise, the percent passing reading went up from 69.7% to 96.5% and the percent overall passing went up from 65.1% to 90.9%. 
* When the data of the 9th graders was included in the school data, Thomas High School was ranked 8th out of 15 for percent overall passing the math and reading.  Once the data of the 9th graders was removed, Thomas High School jumped up to 2nd out of 15, in the district.  Thomas High School was also the lowest ranking charter school before the withdraw of 9th grade student, and again, jumped to second place.  
* When the 9th grade scores were removed, then Thomas High School had a mean of 0 on the 9th grade reading and math tests, while the other schools' data remained the same.  
*The scores by school spending, scores by school size and scores by school type remained almost unchanged, since the size of the sample being removed is so small in relation to the whole population.  

## Summary
The four main changes in the district data after the 9th graders at Thomas High School were changed to zeros was the percent of math passing scores, % of reading passing scores, % of overall passing scores and the ranking of Thomas High School in the district.  This data goes to show how removing a small amount of data from a very large population does not really change the big picture at all.  It will make some changes for Thomas High School, but not for the district.
